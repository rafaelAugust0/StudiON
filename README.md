# StudiON Eventos

In this project who was provided from Imagine School Brazil in your pure construction with HTML, CSS and JS, I decided to reconstruct all the elements and styles using ReactJS to improve my knowledgements from this library and your components, I used some basic concepts from SASS, Router-DOM and FontAwesome to deliver the most better experience to the user.
